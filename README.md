# IrisDroidology/Manacaster

Made by Liam Arbuckle, Manacaster is a Role Playing Game that pits you, a mad scientist, against a series of seemingly never-ending enemies in your quest to find the secret of hyperspace travel. It is loosely tied into my novel [`Star Sailors`](http://github.com/acord-robotics/stellarios/tree/starsailors), being featured in the novel. It is currently undergoing development.

## This Repository 

How this repository works:

* Each little bit I do I create a new branch. This way we have a consistent backup for each part of the project, in case something destructive happens
* When I confirm that the additions work, I create a pull request and delete the arbitrary branch. The file changes, however, can still be seen in the pull request file.

## January 2 2020
I've decided to restart the tutorial. I'm going to go back to previous videos a lot, just so that I don't lose what I've learnt. I learnt a lot during this first run but I feel that I should go through it again.
